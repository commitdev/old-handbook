## FAQ

### How is Commit different from an software consulting agency?

Commit is not a consultancy because we are focussed on finding a great match for our engineers, not just completing work and getting billable hours. We allow our engineers to help decide what they work on and give them room to build up skills outside of client hours.

Traditional consulting agencies will receive projects based on their industry to try and make money. Commit receives projects based on the probability that our startup clients will succeed and the interests of our EPs. We want our EPs to eventually graduate into their dream positions and are set up for success.

Due to this, we are much friendlier to the engineer, nothing like a sweatshop trying to maximize the client hours and put you on tight deadline projects back to back.

In addition to this, our EPs are part of the entire Product Life Cycle of our clients. You’re not there to be a code monkey, you will be an essential part of our clients’ product from inception and product design all the way to launch.


### How is Commit different from a recruitment agency?

Traditional recruiting agencies typically make money purely on successful hires that they’ve referred to their clients. This could mean you may not be placed into a great place to work as it means the recruiting agency will not make money quickly. Commit is different, we will become your employer. As long as you’re with us, you will be paid by us and you can take the time to find your ideal career path and placement. This works because of our Business Model. If you choose a startup that looks great, but then work with them for 3 months and find out it’s not a good fit, it’s no problem, Commit is happy to bring you many other opportunities until you’ve found your perfect fit.

Commit is able to continue to support you for as many clients as you need before you choose to move on. Because our revenue is not solely based on a commission from you joining a company, we aren’t trying to pressure you into taking a role you might not fully be suited to.

We work with our clients to build long term relationships, and want you to stay there long term. Recruiting agencies benefit from you jumping careers a lot, as they get more business. Commit’s goals are more long-term.


## Glossary

*EP (Engineering Partner)*: The standard title given to engineers when they join Commit. Commit does not give specific titles to engineers, we want engineers to have control over their career and be able to jump from one role to another based on what they want for their career path.
